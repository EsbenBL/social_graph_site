# Data

Here we have the different datasets which we used for the project. To load the data into python, we suggest you use the following code-snippet:

```tpl
import requests
data = requests.get(dataset_url).json() 
```
Note that all of the datasets are in a json/dictionary format.

[Edgelist data](/placeholder.json)

[Text dataset](/placeholder.json)
