# Hierarchical Stochastic Block Model

What is it? Who is it? Where is it? and why is it? 

We have identified 21 relevant topics, and named them based on the 10 most prevalent words within each topics.

For an introductory reading into HSBM, we recommend [Gerlach et al. 2018](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaq1360).

Below, We plot the word-document bipartite network generated thought hSBM, where document-nodes are on the left, and word-nodes are on the right. In this case, each document-node represents a scientist.
