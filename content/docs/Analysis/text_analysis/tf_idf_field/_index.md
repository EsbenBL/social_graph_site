# TF-IDF within the Disciplines

To find out which concept/content are most definitive for each of the scientific disciplines, we have calculate the `term frequency` (TF) as well as the `term frequency - inverse document frequency` (TF-IDF) for each of the 5 fields.

Furthermore, we have also calculated both TF and TF-IDF for each of the 21 identified network communities, to see if the community partition was meaningsful with regard to the content of the wikipages.  

For a further elaboration on both metrics follow [this link](https://sodas.ku.dk/people/Jonas_Pedersen__140x174.jpg)
