# Basic Statistics

Below, we plot the network, excluding singleton nodes:

The plot is indeed interesting. 

Further, we present the degree distribution of the network. 

Here is the in-degree distribution:

And here is the out-degree distribution:

<img src="/out_deg_dist.png" alt="Out-degree distribution" style="width:800px;"/>

How about that, Ganon?
